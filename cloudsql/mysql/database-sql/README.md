# Connecting to Cloud SQL (MySQL) from a Go web app

This repo contains the Go source code for a simple web app that can be deployed to App Engine Standard. It is a demonstration of how to connect to a MySQL instance in Cloud SQL. The application is the "Tabs vs Spaces" web app used in the [Building Stateful Applications With Kubernetes and Cloud SQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVgzP3PsXFw&t=1833s) session at Cloud Next '19.

## Before you begin

1. If you haven't already, set up a Go Development Environment by following the [Go setup guide](https://cloud.google.com/go/docs/setup) and 
[create a project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project).

1. Create a 2nd Gen Cloud SQL Instance by following these 
[instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/create-instance). Note the connection string,
database user, and database password that you create.

1. Create a database for your application by following these 
[instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/create-manage-databases). Note the database
name. 

1. Create a service account with the 'Cloud SQL Client' permissions by following these 
[instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/connect-external-app#4_if_required_by_your_authentication_method_create_a_service_account).
Download a JSON key to use to authenticate your connection.

## Running locally

To run this application locally, download and install the `cloud_sql_proxy` by
following the instructions
[here](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/sql-proxy#install).

Instructions are provided below for using the proxy with a TCP connection or a Unix Domain Socket. On Linux or Mac OS you can use either option, but on Windows the proxy currently requires a TCP connection.

### Launch proxy with TCP

To run the sample locally with a TCP connection, set environment variables and launch the proxy as shown below.

#### Linux / Mac OS
Use these terminal commands to initialize environment variables:
```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service/account/key.json
export DB_TCP_HOST='127.0.0.1:3306'
export DB_USER='<DB_USER_NAME>'
export DB_PASS='<DB_PASSWORD>'
export DB_NAME='<DB_NAME>'
```

Then use this command to launch the proxy in the background:
```bash
./cloud_sql_proxy -instances=<project-id>:<region>:<instance-name>=tcp:3306 -credential_file=$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS &
```

#### Windows/PowerShell
Use these PowerShell commands to initialize environment variables:
```powershell
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="<CREDENTIALS_JSON_FILE>"
$env:DB_TCP_HOST="127.0.0.1:3306"
$env:DB_USER="<DB_USER_NAME>"
$env:DB_PASS="<DB_PASSWORD>"
$env:DB_NAME="<DB_NAME>"
```

Then use this command to launch the proxy in a separate PowerShell session:
```powershell
Start-Process -filepath "C:\<path to proxy exe>" -ArgumentList "-instances=<project-id>:<region>:<instance-name>=tcp:3306 -credential_file=<CREDENTIALS_JSON_FILE>"
```

### Launch proxy with Unix Domain Socket
NOTE: this option is currently only supported on Linux and Mac OS. Windows users should use the [Launch proxy with TCP](#launch-proxy-with-tcp) option.

To use a Unix socket, you'll need to create the `/cloudsql` directory and give write access to the user running the proxy. Use these commands to create the directory and set permissions:
```bash
sudo mkdir /cloudsql
sudo chown -R $USER /cloudsql
```

Use these terminal commands to initialize environment variables:
```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service/account/key.json
export INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME='<MY-PROJECT>:<INSTANCE-REGION>:<INSTANCE-NAME>'
export DB_USER='<DB_USER_NAME>'
export DB_PASS='<DB_PASSWORD>'
export DB_NAME='<DB_NAME>'
```

Then use this command to launch the proxy in the background:
```bash
./cloud_sql_proxy -dir=/cloudsql --instances=$INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME --credential_file=$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS &
```

### Testing the application

To test the application locally, follow these steps after the proxy is running:

* Install dependencies: `go get ./...`
* Run the application: `go run cloudsql.go`
* Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in a web browser to verify your application is running correctly.

## Deploying to App Engine Standard

To run the sample on GAE-Standard, create an App Engine project by following the setup for these 
[instructions](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/quickstart#before-you-begin).

First, create an `app.yaml` with the correct values to pass the environment 
variables into the runtime. Your app.yaml file should look like this:

```yaml
runtime: go111
env_variables:
  INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME: <project-id>:<region>:<instance-name>
  DB_USER: YOUR_DB_USER
  DB_PASS: YOUR_DB_PASS
  DB_NAME: YOUR_DB
```

Note: Saving credentials in environment variables is convenient, but not secure - consider a more
secure solution such as [Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/kms/) to help keep secrets safe.

Next, the following command will deploy the application to your Google Cloud project:
```bash
gcloud app deploy
```
