## How to Make Paella

Paella is a classic Spanish rice dish, known for its vibrant flavors and beautiful presentation. While there are many variations, this recipe will guide you through a popular seafood and chicken version.

### Ingredients:

*   2 tablespoons olive oil
*   1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
*   1/2 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
*   1/2 pound mussels, scrubbed and de-bearded
*   1 large onion, chopped
*   1 red bell pepper, chopped
*   4 cloves garlic, minced
*   1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
*   1 teaspoon smoked paprika
*   1/2 teaspoon saffron threads (or more, to taste)
*   2 cups paella rice (Bomba or Calasparra)
*   4 cups chicken broth, warmed
*   1/2 cup frozen peas
*   Lemon wedges, for serving
*   Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish
*   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

### Equipment:

*   Large paella pan (or a wide, shallow pan or skillet)

### Instructions:

**1. Prepare the Saffron:**
If using saffron threads, steep them in a small amount of warm chicken broth for about 15-20 minutes to extract their color and flavor. This will infuse the paella with that signature golden hue. ![image](example-image-2.png)**2. Cook the Chicken:**
Heat the olive oil in your paella pan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook until browned on all sides. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside. You want a nice sear on the chicken to develop flavor. ![image](example-image-4.png)**3. Sauté Aromatics:**
Add the chopped onion and bell pepper to the same pan (add a little more olive oil if needed). Cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Then add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. ![image](example-image-6.png)**4. Build the Flavor Base:**
Stir in the diced tomatoes (undrained) and smoked paprika. Cook for about 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. This creates a rich "sofrito" base for the paella. ![image](example-image-8.png)
