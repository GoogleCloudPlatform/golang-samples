**Step 1: Sauté the Aromatics**

Heat the olive oil in a large paella pan or a wide, shallow pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Sauté until softened, about 5-7 minutes. ![image](example-image-2.png)**Step 2: Add Tomatoes and Rice**

Stir in the chopped tomatoes and cook for another 3-5 minutes, allowing them to break down slightly. Then add the paella rice, stirring to coat it evenly with the oil and vegetables. ![image](example-image-4.png)**Step 3: Introduce Broth and Saffron**

Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth. If using, crumble in the saffron threads. Bring the mixture to a simmer. ![image](example-image-6.png)**Step 4: Add Protein and Cook**

Add your chosen protein (chicken pieces, shrimp, mussels, etc.) distributing them evenly over the rice. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan loosely with foil (if your pan doesn't have a lid), and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until most of the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Avoid stirring the paella while it cooks, as this prevents the formation of the desirable "socarrat" (crispy bottom layer). ![image](example-image-8.png)**Step 5: Add Peas and Finish**

During the last 5 minutes of cooking, stir in the peas. Once the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed, remove the pan from the heat. Let it rest, covered, for 5-10 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld and the rice to fully steam. ![image](example-image-10.png)
