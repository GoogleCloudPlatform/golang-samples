# Apache Kafka for BigQuery API

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/cloud.google.com/go/managedkafka.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go/managedkafka)

Go Client Library for Apache Kafka for BigQuery API.

## Install

```bash
go get cloud.google.com/go/managedkafka
```

## Stability

The stability of this module is indicated by SemVer.

However, a `v1+` module may have breaking changes in two scenarios:

* Packages with `alpha` or `beta` in the import path
* The GoDoc has an explicit stability disclaimer (for example, for an experimental feature).

### Which package to use?

Generated client library surfaces can be found in packages who's import path
ends in `.../apivXXX`. The `XXX` could be something like `1` or `2` in the case
of a stable service backend or may be like `1beta2` or `2beta` in the case of a
more experimental service backend. Because of this fact, a given module can have
multiple clients for different service backends. In these cases it is generally
recommend to use clients with stable service backends, with import suffixes like
`apiv1`, unless you need to use features that are only present in a beta backend
or there is not yet a stable backend available.
