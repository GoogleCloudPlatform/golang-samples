# Google Cloud Speech API Go example

For more details, see the [Using Enhanced Models](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/enhanced-models) tutorial in the docs.

> **Caution**: If you attempt to use an enhanced model but your Google Cloud Project does not have data logging enabled, Speech-to-Text API sends a `400` HTTP code response with the status `INVALID_ARGUMENT`. You must [enable data logging](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/enable-data-logging) to use the enhanced speech recognition models.
