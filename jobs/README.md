people find jobs more easily. Job Discovery provides plug and play access to 
Googleâ€™s search and machine learning capabilities, enabling the entire recruiting
ecosystem - company career sites, job boards, applicant tracking systems, and
staffing agencies to improve job site engagement and candidate conversion.

go get -u google.golang.org/api/jobs/v2
