# Dialogflow: Go samples

Dialogflow samples using the Go client.

## Before you begin

1. If your project does not already have a Dialogflow agent, create one
   following [these
   instructions](https://dialogflow.com/docs/getting-started/building-your-first-agent#create_an_agent).

   (If you want to create an enterprise agent, follow [these
   instructions](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow-enterprise/docs/quickstart)
   instead.)

2. This sample comes with a [sample
   agent](./resources/RoomReservation.zip)
   which you can use to run the samples. Follow [these
   instructions](https://dialogflow.com/docs/best-practices/import-export-for-versions)
   to import the agent from the [Dialogflow
   console](https://console.dialogflow.com/api-client/).

   (**Warning:** Importing the sample agent will add intents and entities to
   your Dialogflow agent. You may want to use a separate Google Cloud Platform
   project, or export your existing Dialogflow agent before importing the sample
   agent.)
